# <!-- fit --> Projector: Your Remote IDE

Pasha Finkelshteyn, JetBrains

# <!-- fit --> Did you ever complain?

- You need to set up a VPN to access data?
- You need to use RDP to access your instance of IDEA?
- Or even VNC?
- *Long* indexing?
- Huge project compiles forever?

# Did you ever want?

- Edit code from tablet/smartphone?
- Help your colleague to fix some issues?
- Show demo which accesses data from your cloud?
- Work from a weak laptop?

# Issues with existing solutions. VPN

1. OpenVPN does not scale
    1. No central identity management
    1. No failover OOTB
1. Proprietary solutions areâ€¦ proprietary
1. And expensive sometimes
1. IKE is not completely cross-platform

---

# Issues with existing solutions. VNC

1. **Extremely** slow
2. Complex infrastructure (VPN?)

---

# Issues with existing solutions. RDP

RDP is awesome

1. Single-user
2. Still needs complex infrastructure to provide access
